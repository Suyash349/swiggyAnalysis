 Key Insights from Data Analysis
 

Restaurant Distribution
The bar chart shows that **Kolkata** has the highest number of restaurants in the dataset, followed by **Bangalore** and **Delhi**. This suggests a high market saturation and competition in these cities.


Popular Cuisines
The most popular food types are **North Indian**, **Chinese**, and **South Indian**. This indicates a strong demand for these cuisines across the analyzed cities.


Price vs. Ratings
The box plot illustrates that the median average ratings are quite consistent across different price ranges. This suggests that customers are generally satisfied with restaurants in all price segments, and a higher price does not necessarily guarantee a higher average rating.


Delivery Time and Ratings
The scatter plot shows a weak correlation between delivery time and average ratings. This indicates that while delivery time is a factor, it may not be the primary driver of a restaurant's rating. Other factors like food quality and customer service likely play a more significant role.

Summary 
This project successfully leveraged Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze Swiggy restaurant data. The analysis provided valuable insights into the market landscape, popular food types, and key drivers of restaurant performance. These findings can be used to develop data-driven strategies for business growth and customer satisfaction.
